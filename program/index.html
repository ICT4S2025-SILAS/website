                Distributing trust over multiple parties can help to improve security guarantees.
                One can design a system so that instead of hacking one server, attackers need to attack two parties for a successful attack.
                We designed such a system for pseudonimisation and encryption, called n-PEP, where the core functionality is distributed over n servers.
                This comes at a cost, however, as the systems needs more operational servers.
                We calculate and compare the additional cost that this distribution of costs actual takes, so that system architects can incorporate this in their decisions.
